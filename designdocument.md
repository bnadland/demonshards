# Design Document

## Campaign

There is global timeline that progresses with every mission. At certain points
in this timeline attacks from the Demons are triggered. The farther this
timeline is the more and powerful are the enemies. If this timeline progresses
too far the game is lost.

To stop the threat you need to carry out story/research missions that a) give
you more information on the threat and b) unlock missions to push the invasion
back.

You sometimes get to choose missions that eliminate or drastically reduce certain
enemytypes from your campaign (e.g. destroying a big nest with explosives will reduce
the chance that this enemy comes in later missions).

The rough progression of story elements is roughly the same everytime, but
their appearance on the timeline is not completely fixed and they have
variations between each campaign.

## Enemies

There are a few dozen enemy types. Each has different possible abilities and
weaknesses.  At campaign start it is random generated how the enemy works
exactly. So you have the basic enemy behaviour every playthrough but the
details differ everytime.

## Enemytypes

Maggots: one of the first enemy type, slow and weak but consume biomass and destroy
the land where they appear. Also mutate later into different types.

Zombies: a parasite that affects humans and effectively turn them into brainless zombies. They can sometimes explode into flames on contact,
some can also jumpattack on their last moveaction and cover a lot of ground pretty fast that way

Spiders: a fast but fragile enemytype that can paralyze, poison or sometimes spit fire

Bloodivies: immobile plant that can paralyze unexpected bypassers and sometimes poison them

Werewolf: a fast and ferocious enemy, has a jumpattack and can have a flame spit or poison aura

## Characterdevelopment

There are no skills or abilities, customization is completely handled via
equipment. You spend resource points on each viking and buy options that he is
trained in to take into missions. Equipment is not transferable. You buy ammo
and grenade "slots", used equipment gets refilled after the mission.

Before every mission you decide from the options what everyone takes with him.
You can take multiple primary weapons.

## Mission preparation

Before every mission you get a synopsys of what type of enemies are confirmed
in the area, what your goal is and how many resource point you get for
achieving this goal.

You then decide what every viking takes with him out of his equipment pool. The
more you take the heavier his load, the less movement he can do and the higher
the complication chance starts off.

## Mission

The mission is a grid based tactical view. You control your squad turn based.
Every viking has two actionpoints for every turn. You can move for one point or
dash for two points.  You can use equipment or weapons for one or two points
depending on your equipment. All actions that are not movement end the turn for
this viking. If you have a weapon equipped and ammo for it you can also end
your turn with an overwatch action.

Beside the mission goal, there is sometimes reason to explore a bit if you
still have enough equipment.  You sometimes get side goals with additional
resource points or other benefits.

## Complication chance

You start every mission with a random complication chance. Every viking you
take and his load rises this chance.  Every turn within a mission also raises
this percentage and a check is done against it. A complication can be that you
come into an ambush, that enemies gather and swarm into the mission map, a
weapon malfunction, etc.

## Backstory

You are on a foreign planet. It was formerly a really cold planet mostly
covered in ice.  Due to terraforming it became warmer and more habitable for
humans. You are part of the colony on this planet.

At the start of the campaign you get news that some remote parts of the colony
lost contact.  You soon find out that some sort of insectoid race and/or demons
are also on this planet. They hibernated in the ice and are now awoken from the
terraforming.
