# Demonshards

You are a demon hunter. You guild guards the banishment crystals on the isle of
hunters since the last demon war thousands of years ago.  Every hunter is
trained here to be sent out into the world to banish the remaining lesser
demons that haunt the lands of man. During the winter time they come back to
the island to rest, to learn in the halls of wisdom and to record their
experiences in new tomes for the next generations.

You have done this for years, but this time it is different. When you came back
the isle is overrun with lesser demons and greater demons that you never have
seen and that have been banished for hundreds of years.

## Gameplay

There are no loot drops. Every defeated demon gives "Demonshards". They are
used to buy skills when resting.

Weapons, Armor, Talismans, etc. are grabbed from other fallen hunters that
where overwhelmed by the demons.

Potions, Oils, etc. are crafted from materials and herbs that you find on the
island.
